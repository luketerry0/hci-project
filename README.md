No installation is required, as it is hosted online. Fortawesome was used for icons, freesound.org and pixabay.com used for sounds. The app itself is simply built using Angular CLI 17.3.11. Building the app locally requires npm and node.js, as these are used to create a development server for the Angular app. All other requirements can be found under hci-project/node_modules.
